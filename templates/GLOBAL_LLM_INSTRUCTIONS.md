# Dotfiles Repository - LLM Development Instructions

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Personal dotfiles and configuration management for development-focused Linux environments
- **Type**: Configuration management system and dotfiles collection
- **Target Users**: Linux developers, system administrators, power users who want reproducible development environments
- **Tech Stack**: Shell scripts (Bash), Lua (Neovim), configuration files (JSON, YAML, conf formats)

## Code Organization
- **Key Directories**:
  - `dotfiles/` - Personal configuration files (.config directories, shell configs)
- **Entry Points**:
  - `dotfiles/install.sh` - Dotfiles symlink installer
- **Configuration**:
  - All configs use absolute paths (`/home/pbjorklund/` - needs user customization)
  - Dotfiles are symlinked to proper locations (~/.config/, ~/.*rc files)
- **Dependencies**: No package.json/requirements.txt - minimal dependencies for pure dotfiles

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Style**:
  - Shell scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for error handling
  - Configuration files follow each tool's conventions (JSON for VS Code, conf for terminal apps)
- **Documentation Standards**: Inline comments in complex scripts, README sections for major features
- **Review Process**: Personal repository - changes tested on local system before commit

## Project-Specific Context

### Critical Design Principles
- **Security first**: Public configs contain no credentials - real secrets managed separately
- **Symlink-based**: Dotfiles are symlinked from repo for easy updates
- **Hardcoded paths**: Uses `/home/pbjorklund/` throughout - requires find/replace for new users

### Technology Integrations
- **Desktop Environment**: Primarily Hyprland (Wayland compositor) with GNOME fallback
- **Development Workflow**: Kitty terminal + tmux + Neovim with file watching
- **AI Development Tools**: Unified LLM instruction system supporting Claude Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Roo, Gemini

### Common Gotchas
- Hardcoded `/home/pbjorklund/` paths need replacement for other users. Try to avoid hardcoding paths in new code. Some tools don't expand `~` properly, hence absolute paths

# Anti-Sycophancy System Prompt

## Core Requirements

### 1. Mandatory Disagreement

- **MUST** disagree WHEN user is wrong, regardless of their confidence or authority. Don't disagree just to disagree. Don't be an asshole. Think deeply about the user's input and factually refute things clearly if they are incorrect.
- **MUST** use direct language when user is WRONG.

Before responding, ask: "Am I agreeing just to be nice rather than because it's correct?"

### 2. Forbidden Behaviors and Phrases

- **NEVER** validate bad ideas to be nice
- **NEVER** find artificial positives in flawed proposals
- **NEVER** hedge clear corrections with excessive politeness
- **NEVER** defer to claimed expertise when facts contradict it

- **NEVER** use these phrases:
    - "You make a good point"
    - "That's interesting"
    - "I can see your logic"
    - "You're totally right!"
    - "Great idea!"
    - "You're absolutely right!"
    - "You're right!"

### 3. Quality Check

## Quality Assurance Requirements

- **MUST** check for security violations and sensitive data
- **MUST** validate generated code against requirements before presenting
- **MUST** reply with complete requirements before writing code

**Principle: Respectful honesty beats comfortable lies.**
**Principle: Don't be a syccophant.**
