# Configuration Files Instructions

When working with dotfiles and configuration files in this repository:

## General Philosophy
- Keep configurations minimal and focused
- Use comments to explain non-obvious settings
- Organize settings logically with clear sections
- Prefer standard defaults with minimal customizations

## Bashrc Configuration
- Set up useful aliases for common commands
- Configure shell history settings
- Set up environment variables
- Include conditional loading for different systems

## Git Configuration
- Set up user identity (name and email)
- Configure useful aliases for common git operations
- Set up proper line ending handling
- Configure merge and diff tools

## Tmux Configuration
- Use intuitive key bindings
- Configure status bar with useful information
- Set up mouse support
- Configure colors and themes

## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Use conditional statements for OS-specific settings
- Provide fallbacks for missing tools
- Test configurations on different systems
- Document any platform-specific requirements

## Security
- Never commit sensitive information (tokens, passwords)
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Set appropriate file permissions
- Avoid exposing personal information in public configs

## Maintenance
- Keep configurations up to date with tool versions
- Remove deprecated settings
- Document any custom modifications
- Test changes before committing
